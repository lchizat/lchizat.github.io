= Particle gradient flows

Many tasks in machine learning and signal processing require to minimize the convex function of a measure:
\(
\min_{\mu \in \mathcal{M}(\Theta)} J(\mu)
\)
where $\mathcal{M}(\Theta)$ is the space of measures on a manifold $\Theta$. For this optimization problem, we investigate the method that consists in discretizing the measure into particles $\mu = \sum_{i=1}^m w_i \delta_{\theta_i}$ and taking the gradient flow of $J$ in the parameters $(w_i,\theta_i)_i$. We show that quite generically, this gradient flow converges to global minimizers in the many-particle limit $m,t \to \infty$, under two main conditions:
- the differential of $J$, seen has a continuous function, has some "homogeneity directions", and 
- the initial distribution of particles is admissible.

=== Animations
We display below animated versions of the particle gradient flows shown in Section 4 of the preprint, as well as a particle gradient flow corresponding to the training of a neural network with a single hidden layer and sigmoid activation function in dimension d=2. In all these cases, the global minimizer (supported on the dotted lines in the plots) is found. The time scale is logarithmic.

Here we solve the BLasso problem for recovering a sum-of-impulse signal given noisy and filtered observations. The positions $\theta(t)$ of the particles are shown horizontally and weight $w(t)$ shown vertically.

*Neural networks with a single hidden layer*

We train such a network on a synthetic well-specified problem with SGD.

ReLU activation function: we show for each particle the trajectory $\vert w(t)\vert\cdot \theta(t)\in \mathbb{R}^2$.
