Master Optimizatiom, Université Paris Saclay, 2019/2020


== Mandatory registration

The class will be taught in French or English, depending on attendance (all slides and class notes are in English).

== Summary

Optimal transport is a powerful mathematical theory at the interface between optimization and probability theory with far reaching applications. It defines a natural tool to study probability distributions in the many situations where they appear: data science, partial differential equations, statistics or shape processing. In this course we will present the classical theory of optimal transport, efficient algorithms to compute it and applications.

Pre-requisites: notions on measure theory, weak convergence, and convex analysis. Some basics knowledge of Python.

== Dates
Classes will be held in the room 1A13 (1st floor, Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay), wednesday afternoon from 13:30 to 17:00. Class notes will be made available. Practical sessions will be held on laptops with Python 3 and Jupyter notebooks (please make sure to install it before January 17, and run this script).
