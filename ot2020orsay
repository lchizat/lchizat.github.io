== Summary

Optimal transport is a powerful mathematical theory at the interface between optimization and probability theory with far reaching applications. It defines a natural tool to study probability distributions in the many situations where they appear: data science, partial differential equations, statistics or shape processing. In this course we will present the classical theory of optimal transport, efficient algorithms to compute it and applications.

/Pre-requisites/: Notions on measure theory, weak convergence, and convex analysis. Some basic knowledge of Python.

/Language/: The class will be taught in French or English, depending on attendance (all slides and class notes are in English).

/Evaluation/: Practical sessions to finish at home + written in-class exam


== Dates
Classes will be held in the room 1A13 (1st floor, Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay), Wednesday afternoon from 13:30 to 17:00. Class notes will be made available. Practical sessions will be held on laptops with Python 3 and Jupyter notebooks (please make sure to install it before March 4, and run [files2020ot/crash_test.ipynb this script]). If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, check out [files2020ot/TP0.ipynb this introduction exercise].
