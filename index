== PhD thesis
I defended my PhD thesis entitled /Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Models, Numerical Methods, Applications/, at Université Paris-Dauphine (PSL Research university) on November 10th 2017. My thesis advisors were [http://gpeyre.github.io/ G. Peyré] and [https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~vialard/ F-X. Vialard].

- [files/CHIZAT_phdthesis.pdf PhD manuscript] (in English)

== Research interests
- optimal transport and variational problems in the space of measures
- continuous optimization algorithms (convex and non-convex)
- applications to statistical learning and signal processing
