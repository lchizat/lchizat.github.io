== PhD thesis
I prepared my PhD thesis at Université Paris Dauphine under the supervision of [http://gpeyre.github.io/ G. Peyré] and [https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~vialard/ F-X. Vialard].
I have defended my PhD thesis on November 10th 2017.

== Research interests
During my PhD, I mostly developed models, numerical methods and applications for *unbalanced optimal transport*. My interest has recently shifted to the use of optimal transport in statistical learning.
