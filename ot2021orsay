Master Optimization, Université Paris-Saclay, spring 2021


[*Mandatory registration (TBD*]



== Summary

Optimal transport is a powerful mathematical theory at the interface between optimization and probability theory with far reaching applications. It defines a natural tool to study probability distributions in the many situations where they appear: data science, partial differential equations, statistics or shape processing. In this course we will present the classical theory of optimal transport, efficient algorithms to compute it and applications.

/Pre-requisites/: Notions on measure theory, weak convergence, and convex analysis. Some basic knowledge of Python.

/Language/: The class will be taught in French or English, depending on attendance (all slides and class notes are in English).

/Evaluation/: TBD
