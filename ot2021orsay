== Summary

Optimal transport is a powerful mathematical theory at the interface between optimization and probability theory with far reaching applications. It defines a natural tool to study probability distributions in the many situations where they appear: data science, partial differential equations, statistics or shape processing. In this course we will present the classical theory of optimal transport, efficient algorithms to compute it and applications.

/Pre-requisites/: Notions on measure theory, weak convergence, and convex analysis. Some basic knowledge of Python.

/Language/: The class will be taught in French or English, depending on attendance (all slides and class notes are in English).

/Organisation/: lectures will take place on this BigBlueButton server [https://bbb2.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/b/luc-wqz-da9] on Wednesdays afternoon between 2pm and 5pm. This format is subject to modifications in the coming days, register to receive the updates.

/Evaluation/: Practical session (short) reports & short report (10 pages max) on a research article &  oral presentation (if possible)
